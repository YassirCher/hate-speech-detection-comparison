        "# Hate Speech Detection using LSTM\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook implements a deep learning model for hate speech detection using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The project utilizes the `tdavidson/hate_speech_offensive` dataset and augments it with generated non-offensive sentences to improve class balance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Workflow Overview\n",
        "1. **Data Loading**: Load the hate speech dataset.\n",
        "2. **Data Augmentation**: Generate neutral/positive sentences to balance the dataset.\n",
        "3. **Preprocessing**: Clean text, lemmatize, and tokenize.\n",
        "4. **Feature Engineering**: One-hot encoding and sequence padding.\n",
        "5. **Class Balancing**: Apply SMOTE to handle class imbalance.\n",
        "6. **Model Building**: Construct an LSTM-based neural network.\n",
        "7. **Training & Evaluation**: Train the model and evaluate performance using metrics and confusion matrices.\n",
        "8. **Inference**: Predict classes for new sentences."
